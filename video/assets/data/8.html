</div>
<p>Daario is a Tyroshi sell-sword, employed as a lieutenant in the Second Sons. He killed his company's co-captains, Mero and Prendahl na Ghezn, and took command of the Second Sons. His weapons-of-choice are a stiletto and an arakh, with custom-made hilts in the shape of beautiful, naked women. He wants to help Daenerys Targaryen in her attempt to take Yunkai, but she doesnâ€™t fully trust him.</p>
