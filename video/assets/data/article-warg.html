<p>Wargs are people with the ability to enter the minds of animals and perceive the world through their senses and even control their actions. The act of doing this is called « warging".</p>

<p>The ability starts out as vivid dreams in which the warg sees and perceives the world through the senses of an animal. Over time and with practice a warg can enter the mind of an animal at will. A warg's human body will become comatose when his consciousness leaves it to enter the mind of an animal, and his eyes will glaze over white, until his consciousness returns to his own body.</p>
