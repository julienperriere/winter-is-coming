	<h2>Daenerys Targaryen</h2>
</div>
<p>Daenerys Targaryen, sometimes called Dany by her brother Viserys, is a major character in the first, second and third seasons. She is played by starring cast member Emilia Clarke, and debuts in the series premiere. The role of Daenerys was originally played by Tamzin Merchant in the unaired pilot episode, but the role was recast for the actual series for undisclosed reasons.</p>
<p>She is the only surviving child of King Aerys II Targaryen, who was ousted from the Iron Throne during Robert's Rebellion. Daenerys' mother was sent to safety on Dragonstone island just before the Sack of King's Landing, and died giving birth to her during a great storm which wrecked the remaining Targaryen fleet at anchor, earning her the sobriquet Daenerys Stormborn.</p>
