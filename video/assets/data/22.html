<p>The Twins, sometimes known as The Crossing, is a castle in the Riverlands. It is the seat of House Frey. It consists of two near-identical towers and a fortified bridge over the Green Fork of the River Trident. The Twins represents the only crossing point over the Green Fork for hundreds of miles in either direction. It is a major barrier to travelers and merchants traveling from the North to the western Riverlands.</p>
