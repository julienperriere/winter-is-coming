	<h2>Walder Frey</h2>
</div>
<p>Walder Frey rules the Twins as the head of House Frey and Lord of the Crossing. Though past ninety years old and infirm, he still maintains an active hand in the running of his house. Because the use of the Twins becomes a strategic necessity for Robb Stark, Walder is able to negotiate marriage contracts for his children to Robb. Though, Robb Stark doesnâ€™t keep his word and marry Jeyne Westerling, creating a tension between the Frey and the Stark.</p>
