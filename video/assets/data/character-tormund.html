<p>Tormund, better known as Tormund Thunderfist, is a trusted leader in his own right of a large warband of wildlings. He has joined his forces to those of King-Beyond-the-Wall Mance Rayder, and now functions as one of Mance's most trusted lieutenants. In season 3, Tormund leads twenty other of the Free Folk, including Jon Snow and Ygritte, in scaling The Wall, where he was instructed to await a signal from Mance.</p>
