	<h2>Sandor Clegane</h2>
</div>

<p>Sandor Clegane, nicknamed The Hound was the personal bodyguard of Joffrey Baratheon. He joined the Kingsguard when Joffrey took the Iron Throne, but deserted his post during the Battle of the Blackwater.</p>

<p>He is taciturn and brutal but not without compassion. His face bears scars from burning and he is known for his fierce demeanor and lack of chivalry. He is the younger brother of Ser Gregor Clegane, nicknamed "the Mountain", a monstrously huge knight and arguably the most feared man in Westeros. In his youth Gregor nearly burned off half of Sandor's face. Ever since, Sandor has been deeply afraid of fire.</p>
