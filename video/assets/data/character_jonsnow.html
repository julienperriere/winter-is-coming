	<h2>Jon Snow</h2>
</div>

<p>Jon Snow is the bastard son of the late Lord Eddard Stark of Winterfell. Jon was raised at Winterfell on an equal footing with Eddard's legitimate children, but his origins were always a sensible subject in the family. He wields the bastard sword, Longclaw. Jon is a steward in the Night's Watch.</p>

<p>In season 2, Jon is captured by a willing named Ygritte. He has an ambiguous relationship with her, though. King-Beyond-the-Wall Mance Rayder accepts to spare him, but he has no choice but to become a willing himself.</p>
